# Demo Blockchain

Welcome to the Demo Blockchain repository! This project showcases a simplified implementation of a blockchain using the JavaScript language. This README provides an overview of the key features and functionalities of the demo blockchain, including the consensus algorithm used, block creation and validation process, transaction management, and a basic blockchain explorer.

## Features

The Demo Blockchain includes the following key features and functionalities:

### Consensus Algorithm

The blockchain utilizes the **Proof-of-Work** (PoW) consensus algorithm. PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to add new blocks to the blockchain. This mechanism ensures the security and integrity of the blockchain by making it computationally expensive and time-consuming to alter the transaction history.

### Block Creation and Validation

1. **Block Structure**: Each block consists of an index, timestamp, list of transactions, a reference to the previous block's hash, and a nonce for PoW.
2. **Mining**: Miners compete to find a nonce that, when hashed with the block data, results in a hash with a specific number of leading zeros. This process requires computational effort and contributes to the consensus mechanism.
3. **Difficulty Adjustment**: The blockchain adjusts the mining difficulty periodically to maintain a consistent block creation rate.

### Transaction Management

1. **Transaction Structure**: Transactions contain sender and recipient addresses, transaction amount, and a digital signature.
2. **Transaction Validation**: Transactions are verified by checking the digital signature against the sender's public key. Transactions with valid signatures are added to the pending transactions pool.

### Blockchain Explorer

The demo blockchain includes a basic **blockchain explorer** to visualize the blocks and transactions. It allows users to view the entire blockchain, explore individual blocks, and review transactions within each block.

## Usage

To run the Demo Blockchain and explore its functionalities, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Demo-Blockchain`.
3. Open a terminal and run: `node index.js`.

The demo blockchain will start mining new blocks, validating transactions, and updating the blockchain explorer.
